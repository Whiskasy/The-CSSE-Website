        <h4>What does it do?</h4>
            <p> <blockquote> CSSE Chatbot is a specialized AI chatbot that can answer all your computer science and software engineering questions. This includes frequently asked questions, general academic help and much more!
            </blockquote> </p>
            
        <h4>How does it work?</h4>
            <p> <blockquote>Simply type in your question in the chatbot window and the chatbot will provide you with an answer. It's that simple!
                Whenever you send a prompt, a call is made to the OpenRouter chatbot API, it uses the deepseek v3 model which processes the question and returns a CSSE related response.
                The chatbot is also capable of fetching details on GitHub repositories with the click of a button using the GitHub API. This allows you to get the latest information about a specific repository of your choice!
            </blockquote> </p>
        
        <h4>Why?</h4>
            <p> <blockquote>The CSSE Chatbot is a great tool to help students and professionals alike. It can help you with your assignments, projects, general queries or just help you spot plain oversights. It is a useful specialized tool for anyone who has questions about CSSE.
